Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read the value of 'n' (the given number) from the user
Step 3: Initialize variables 'first' and 'second' as 0 and 1 respectively
Step 4: Print the values of 'first' and 'second'
Step 5: Initialize variable 'next' as the sum of 'first' and 'second'
Step 6: Repeat steps 7 and 8 until 'next' is less than or equal to 'n'
Step 7: Print the value of 'next'
Step 8: Update the values of 'first', 'second', and 'next' as follows:
        first = second
        second = next
        next = first + second
Step 9: Stop
