Step 1: Start
Step 2: Read the values of 'start' and 'end' (the two given numbers) from the user
Step 3: Print the prime numbers between 'start' and 'end' using the following steps:
Step 4: Repeat steps 5 to 9 for each number 'num' from 'start' to 'end'
Step 5: Set a flag variable 'isPrime' to true
Step 6: Repeat steps 7 and 8 for each number 'i' from 2 to the square root of 'num'
Step 7: If 'num' is divisible by 'i', set 'isPrime' to false and break the loop
Step 8: If 'isPrime' is true, print 'num' as a prime number
Step 9: Stop
