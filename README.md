# 1. Fibonaci_Algorithm
Algorithm for generating the Fibonacci series up to a given number (Series)
# 2. Prime Numbers Algorithm
# 3. Bubble sort & Merge sort Algorithms 
This implementation shows bubble sort and merge sort algorithms using pyhton and it is then fed with five unsorted arrays of 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 integers, and then graph plot to show their runtime behavior in terms of time taken in nanoseconds versus input size. Also implemention of random numbers generator to generate the numbers, after which the numbers are fed to the implemented algorithms. Finally, a procedure in the code to measure the time taken in nanoseconds. Also included  is discussion of the results of the experiment by comparing how the two algorithms differed as the inputs increased
